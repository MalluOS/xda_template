MalluOS is a free, community built, aftermarket firmware distribution of Android 11 (R), which is designed to increase performance and reliability over stock Android for your device. 
 
MalluOS is based on the LineageOS Project with extra contributions from many people within the Mallu Android community. It can be used without any need to have any Google application installed. You will need to provide your own Google Applications package (gapps). LineageOS does still include various hardware-specific code, which is also slowly being open-sourced anyway. 
 
Our Source code is available in the MalluOS [URL="http://github.com/MalluOS"]Github repo[/URL]
Base source code is available in the LineageOS [URL="http://github.com/LineageOS"]Github repo[/URL].
